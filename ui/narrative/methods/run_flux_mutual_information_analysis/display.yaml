description : |
    <p> The RFMIA app creates a bar chart of information flow through a metabolic model from various environmental perturbations. The various perturbations are decreasingly ranked based on their information flow. The score may be particularly valuable for predicting sensitivity of a metabolic system to given environmental perturbations, which may minimize expensive experiments. </p>

    <p> The App includes a few succinct options of the user interface:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the metabolic FBA model is selected from the models that are loaded in the Narrative environment.
      <li>the base media that is common to all of the examined media conditions</li>
      <li>media compounds to be examined are selected</li>
      <li>the end of the metabolic channel for which the information flow is determined is selected by the user.</li>
    </ol>
